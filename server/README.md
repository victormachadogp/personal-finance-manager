## Categorization Strategy


Amex
Cards statements already include a category for each transaction.
    This is a great feature that makes it easy to categorize transactions.

Nubank
    Nubank does not have a category for each transaction.
        We can use the transaction description to categorize transactions.

Starling
    Has spending categories for each transaction. It also has 'Reference' and 'Counter Party' (will need to consider 'Type' as well).
